This application includes a virtual store and a blog with a content management system. The application was developed
using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and is hosted on
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The content management system of the site is performed using
[Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/), which allows the creation of new posts and products without the need to update the
application code.
